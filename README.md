Common back-end
---

Google will be shutting down Google Reader on July 1. This leaves a void in the marketplace, as many RSS clients use Google Reader as a common back-end. Having a common back end allows users of these clients to move from one device to another while retaining their subscriptions and reading history.

This project creates a new common back-end for clients on all platforms. That back end is built on Correspondence. Unlike a proprietary back-end like Google Reader, Correspondence is designed to let information flow across server boundaries. Set up a new Correspondence distributor, and it will replicate all of the data.

I pledge to fund hosting for this project. My goal is to sell Correspondence hosting for other projects. This one will be a high-profile advertisement for the service.

If you would like to learn about a technology that will become increasingly important as we enter the "post-PC" mobile era, please contribute to this project. If you would like to free your data from closed vendors who may discontinue service at any time, please contribute to this project. If you want to bring a free RSS reader to your favorite platform, please contribute to this project.
